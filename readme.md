# Meallogger Continued

Over the next few days we are going to continue working the meallogger app we started in class today. There are probably many of you that were unable to complete the lab...that's ok! We're going to give you time to finish it up as homework. This is going to be a **three** day homework so you will have ample time to work with each other and the TAs. We're going to keep the MVP reasonable but there are a bunch of bonuses if you're feeling adventurous!

### MVP (minimum viable product)
* If you already haven't, finish the lab including your gist.
* Deploy your app to heroku. This is tricky. We are working with databses now so there's an extra layer of configuration to be aware of.
* Add three new fields. 
    - A timestamp (maybe when you ate the meal)
    - A boolean (maybe if it's spicy or not)
    - A float (maybe the cost of the meal)
* Make sure that after adding these three fields your app's CRUD functionality still works. For instance, think about what you might need to change in your update function to update your new fields.
* Add comments to the boilerplate code. Express generator is amazing, it makes setting up apps much easier but this comes at a cost. You still need to understand what's going on. Take all the code that express generator gives you as well as the any code from the lab you don't understand fully and write comments.

### Bonus
- [Use Querystring instead of Params](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query)
- Add support tables to your database and populate your main table with their foriegn keys.
- If you're comfortable using Querystrings build out a front end form for the user to input their queries.
- Add a custom 404 page. Make it adorable.

### Reading/Viewing
- [MOAR SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/DEfaULT.asP) Forget what you've heard about w3schools this is a great tutorial. You can skip over the things you've already covered but definitely work through the rest.
- [SQL VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vtl2WggqOg) Sorry about the caps, the SQL brings it out in me. This is a great video that goes into depth on SQL. We will work through this stuff in class as well but this is a great resource
- [pg promise documentation](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki/Learn-by-Example) a great place to start on the pg promise library
- [official pg promise docs](http://vitaly-t.github.io/pg-promise/index.html)
- [pay attention to the syntax for these](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-promise#query-result-mask)
